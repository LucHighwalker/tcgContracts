# Project frontline (name tbd)
An ECR721 compliant token.
The generated tokens have their own stats and abilities that can be used in a unity game. Stats are generated based on the card's dna. The use of a blockchain, is to be able to freely trade the cards without any artificial restrictions.

High level plan: The frontend for the app, a unity game, is being developed for the intensive retake. Since the 2 projects coincide to create a single project, I technically only have to do half the work for this class specifically. Giving me ample time to complete the project (at least to a skateboard level).
